# Designing Sustainable Agriculture Databases: Relational and Document-Based Approaches

### Description
This project is part of COMM108 - Data Systems within my MSc program. The task was to;

    1. Create a normalised design for a relational database. You must indicate the 
    associations between entities and the fields each entity contains. Alongside the 
    entity relationship diagram you must provide a rationale for the design. 
    
    2.  Implement SQL that creates a MySQL database implementing the tables in the 
    ERD and insert the test data provided in the sample file. 
    
    3.  Design a RESTful API to access the database you’ve implemented. You must 
    describe the HTTP access method each API route will use, and outline the 
    parameters each will take. Note: You do not need to provide code for this part of the 
    assessment. 
    
    4.  Provide an alternative design for the database that uses a document-based 
    database model. You must provide a balanced reflection of the pros and cons 
    behind the relational and document-based approaches you could take for this 
    specific application.
